## 1. Introduction

The Library Management System (LMS) is a software application designed to efficiently manage the operations of a library. It allows librarians to handle book-related tasks, visitors to borrow and return books, and stock management for keeping track of available books.

This documentation provides an overview of the Library Management System, its features, installation, and usage guide to ensure smooth functioning and help users understand its capabilities.

## 2. System Overview

The LMS is a web-based application accessible from any device with an internet connection. It provides a user-friendly interface for librarians and visitors to perform various tasks related to book management and borrowing.

## 3. User Roles and Permissions

The system has two main user roles:

1. Librarian: Responsible for managing the library's collection, issuing books, receiving returned books, managing stock, and handling notifications.

2. Visitor: Can search for books, view book details, and borrow/return books from the library.

## 4. System Features

### 4.1. Book Management

- Add new books to the library catalog with details like title, author, ISBN, genre, and publication date.
- Edit or update book details if needed.
- Search books by various criteria such as title, author, or genre.
- View book availability status and current stock count.

### 4.2. Visitor Management

- Visitors can register and create an account.
- Visitors can log in to their account to access personalized features.
- Search for books using different parameters like title, author, or genre.
- View book details, including availability status and stock count.
- Borrow books and receive due dates.

### 4.3. Stock Management

- Track the number of available copies for each book.
- Generate reports on book circulation and demand.
- Receive alerts for low stock levels to reorder books.

### 4.4. Notifications

- Automated notifications to visitors for book due dates and return reminders.
- Send notifications to visitors for overdue books or fines.

## 5. System Architecture

The Library Management System follows a client-server architecture. The client-side is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface. The server-side is powered by a backend technology stack that handles data storage, processing, and user authentication.

## 6. Technology Stack

The LMS is built using the following technologies:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (or any other modern frontend framework).
- Backend: Node.js (or any other backend technology like Python, Ruby, etc.).
- Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or any suitable database system.
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication.
- Notifications: Email or SMS services for sending notifications.

## 7. Installation Guide

- Clone the LMS repository from the GitHub repository.
- Install the required dependencies for both the frontend and backend.
- Set up the database and configure the connection.
- Start the server and run the application.

## 8. Usage Guide

- Librarians should log in using their credentials to access the admin panel.
- Visitors can create an account or log in to view and borrow books.
- Librarians can manage books, track stock levels, and handle visitor requests.
- Visitors can search for books, view details, and borrow/return books.

## 9. Troubleshooting

- Check the server logs for any error messages.
- Verify the database connection settings.
- Ensure that all required dependencies are installed.

## 10. Future Enhancements

- Introduce a recommendation system based on visitor preferences.
- Implement an online payment system for overdue fines.
- Allow visitors to write reviews and ratings for books.

## 11. Conclusion

The Library Management System streamlines book management, visitor interactions, and stock control. By automating tasks and providing notifications, the system enhances the overall library experience for both visitors and librarians.
